# React Algolia Movie Search

This app is based on CRA, it connects to Algolia for searching, sorting, and filtering

## Data Set

I'm using the IMDB/TVDB data set with two virtual replicas for sorting. Some of the images in the dataset are broken and returning 404.

## The UI

The UI uses bootstrap with a bit of custom css.

## Searching

Searching is against a single index `movies`. It's possible to search by actor, title, genre, and year
